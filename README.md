# ProductApp
ASP.NET MVC products app

### Tasks
1. Edit for product color is not working. Implement it.
2. There is a failing unit test. There is no problem with the functionality but the test is wrong. Correct it.
3. Currently you can enter a  negative number for stock. Update the code to restrict it to only 0 or positive numbers. A validation error should be displayed if a negative number is entered.
4. Sorting is implemented in products page UI for both name and price. Implement it in the controller also.
5. There is a search filter in the products page. Implement the functionality in the  controller.

### How to make the changes
You need to fork this to your repository and then complete the coding. Once you are done, create a pull request to merge this and let us know.

### Rules
1. Please complete the test on your own.
2. Your screen will be monitored in the actual coding test so no google search during the test.
3. You are supposed to complete it in 45 minutes
